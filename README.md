**SCPUtils Plugin**<br />

Welcome to SCPUtils, overtime i implemented many features so i decided to rework the documentation.

This is the list of SCPUtils features with a brief description, i recomend to read configs:

- **Welcome Message:** You can set in server config a welcome broadcast that every player join will see.
- **Decontamination Message:** A broadcast that all players will see when decontamination starts
- **Auto-Restart:** Having only one player in server may cause round stuck forever, with this plugin you can avoid it!
- **Advanced SCP Suicide / Quit punishements:** If a SCP suicide or leave the server you can punish him, with warns, kicks or bans, depending on settings you use and DC/Suicide percentage player has (configurable also for tutorial role)
- **Temporarily badges:** Sometimes may be useful to give a player a temporarily role for event winners and donators (or anything else you want), with this plugin it's easy, see commands list.
- **Custom nicknames:** Admins with permission can set any nickname to any player in server using admin console, users with permission can set their own nickname using a simple command on User's console.
- **Nickname Blacklist:** You can prevent players joining with blacklisted nicknames and preventing them to change nicknames to restricted ones, users with bypassnickname permission bypass this limit!
- **Badge colors:** Admins can assign a color to every person, users with permissions can assign any color to themselves if it's not in restricted list!
- **Permanently show/hide badges:** Users with permission can permanently show or hide badge using a simple command (in user console)
- **SCPSpeak features:** Playing with permissions you can decide which badge (even default one) can speak with that SCP like 939 using V!
- **Playtime statistics:** You can see each user playtime day per day or total playtime using a simple command!
- **ASNs Bans:** You can ban specific ASNs to avoid ban evaders and cheaters, you can whitelist legit users to bypass the ASNs bans using a simple command, to add an ASN to blacklist add it inside server config setting.
- **Team protection:** Editing configs you can set protection to the teams you want against the teams you want on specific zones or entire map.
- **SCP-096 Target:** Players gets notified via hint when they become a SCP-096 Target.
- **Last Player:** Players gets notified via hint when they are the last player of the Team.
- **Ip check:** Check if player change IP or if player join with more than 1 account associated on same IP

**Each server must have it's own database, you cannot use one database on multiple servers!**<br /><br />
**You must add LiteDB.dll into Plugins/dependencies folder or plugin won't work**<br /><br />
**Minimum requirements: Exiled version: 2.8.0 and LiteDB 5.0.9**

**Config Example**

To edit your configs you must go into EXILED folder and edit port-config.yml file (example 7777-config.yml), and edit them<br />


<br />To edit permissions you must go into Plugins/Exiled Permissions folder and edit permissions.yml file, bellow you can see a sample config<br />

```
    user:
    inheritance: []
        default: true
        permissions:
        - scputils_speak.scp049
    owner:
        permissions:
        - scputils.*
		- scputils_speak.*
    admin:
    inheritance: []
        permissions:       
        - scputils.playerinfo
        - scputils.playerlist
        - scputils.changecolor
        - scputils.changenickname
        - scputils.badgevisibility
        - scputils.playerresetpreferences
        - scputils_speak.*      
    vip:
    inheritance: []
        permissions:        
        - scputils.changecolor
        - scputils.changenickname     
        - scputils_speak.*	  
```		

**Team protection**

CDP = Class-D  <br />
CHI = Chaos Insurgency <br />
MTF = MTF Team (included guards) <br />
RIP = Spectators <br />
RSC = Scientist <br />
SCP = SCP <br />
TUT = Tutorial <br />

*Sample Config for team protection:*<br />

In the following example we will protect Class-D against MTF team and Scientist, since they are listed on cuffed_protected_teams they require to be handcuffed to be protected. They also must be in Entrance or Surface to get protection. <br />

```
  # You have to add the team you want to protect from the target as key and enemy teams on the list as value, on github documentation you can see all the teams.
  cuffed_immunity_players:
    CDP:
    - MTF
    - RSC
  # Indicates if the protected teams should be cuffed to get the protection, if you don't add a team it will get protection regardless
  cuffed_protected_teams:
  - CDP
  # Indicates in which zones the protected team is protected, Zone list: Surface, Entrance, HeavyContainment, LightContainment, Unspecified }
  cuffed_safe_zones:
    CDP:
    - Entrance
    - Surface
```

<br />Using scputils.* grants every permission that starts with prefix scputils
Using '*' grants every possible permission on the server<br />
To verify if you yml file is valid paste it into this website: http://www.yamllint.com/<br />
Note: you must add every group in permissionsm don't forget default one<br /><br />

Data stored on database is intended only for internal use, sharing it is a violation of SCP:SL EULA and will cause your server delist.<br /><br />
